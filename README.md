The code looks pretty missy, but it works... Will make them better to read & modify later.
### Big Updates:

* Fixed the bug in Step One Practice. Right now Step One Practice can be completed for infinite times if the accuracy is below 13/16 (update on Jul 25, 2020)
* Now the images are able to "jump" to the top in an elegant way after being selected (update on Jul 26, 2020)
* Finished coding the main trial part partially (basic task structure, warning, recording and break sessions) update on Jul 27, 2020)
